## About this project

I built a Saas platform and used a bootstrap theme for it. I decided I wanted to learn Tailwind CSS so I figured why not rebuild the admin panel for the Saas platform using Tailwind while learning it at the same time.

My goal for this project is to build it without using jQuery and only using Vue. I removed jQuery from the base application but full-calendar pulls in jQuery so if anyone knows an alternative that doesn't use jQuery that would be great.

## Platforms being used to build the project
* Laravel
* Vue
* Vue Router
* Tailwind

## Current packages being used
* [vue-chartjs](https://vue-chartjs.org/)
* [vue-full-calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-full-calendar)
* [vue-flatpickr-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-flatpickr-component)
* [fontawesome-free](https://fontawesome.com/)

## What needs to be done
* Add packages for things such as date/time picker, color picker, autocomplete, etc..
* Build tailwind components for the following:
    * Panels
    * Buttons
    * Modals
    * Alerts
    * Cards
