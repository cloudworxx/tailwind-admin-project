## About this project

I built a Saas platform and used a bootstrap theme for it. I decided I wanted to learn Tailwind CSS so I figured why not rebuild the admin panel for the Saas platform using Tailwind while learning it at the same time.

## Platforms being used to build the project
* Laravel
* Vue.js
* Tailwind

## Current packages being used
* [vue-chartjs](https://vue-chartjs.org/)
* [vue-full-calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-full-calendar)

## What needs to be done
* Left navigation bar needs functionality, doesn't currently work. It needs to have nested levels.
* Name in upper right corner needs functionality, doesn't currently drop down.

## Getting started
1. Pull down the repository.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Compile the assets with `npm run dev`.
